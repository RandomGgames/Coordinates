# Coordinates-Data-Pack
Displays your coordinates above your hotbar

# How to Install
Download the data pack and either drag and drop into the data pack selection screen or drop into your save's datapacks folder than reload it.

# How to use
After the pack is installed, everyone should have the ability to run the `/trigger Coordinates` command. From there, the `[Power]` button can be clicked with your mouse in order to open a sub menu to change settings. Visual styles and text color can be changed from the other menus.

This pack also comes with a self-disable command which removes all scoreboards and disables the data pack. This can be done by running the `/function disable:coordinates` command.
