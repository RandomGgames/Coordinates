### What is this?
This is a Minecraft data pack that allows you to display your coordaintes above your hotbar.

To activate the display, open the menu in chat by using the command `/trigger Coordinates`. Use your mouse to then click the `[Power]` button and choose an option. This is also how the rest of the menus are navigated and colors/style can also be selected.
